                <p>
                    The Flex-NX Series is one of Fujitec’s proudest technological achievements in dispatching solutions. Standard on all Viridian controllers, there are three available options with varying degrees of capabilities.

                    <span class="bold">FLEX-NX 102:</span> Best utilized in smaller buildings with a relatively limited amount of traffic.

                <div class="flexnx-image flexnx-102"></div>
                <p>
                    <span class="bold">FLEX-NX 252:</span> This solution compliments large-scale buildings with high traffic demands. The 252 Series incorporates a Neuro computer that simulates the learning patterns of a human brain to calculate the fastest and most efficient route of travel for passengers within a building. Software modification is not necessary, as the system continuously adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns which include but are not limited to: The relocation of tenants to different floors; an increase or decrease in building occupancy, changes in operational hours, etc.

                    Depending on the traffic needs of your building, Fujitec’s FLEX-NX is designed to reduce wait times, improve traffic distribution and satisfy the destination needs of tenants. Fujitec firmly believes that our ability to deliver customized destination solutions provides invaluable support to customers that aim to improve building security, efficiency and overall desirability.

                <ol>
                    <li>Passenger registers desired floor using the keypad on the EZ-Shuttle fixture</li>
                    <li>Elevator location/assignment is presented on the EZ-Shuttle display.</li>
                    <li>Passenger moves to designated elevator and waits for arrival.</li>
                    <li>While boarding, destinations are displayed on the floor indicator at the car’s entrance column.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    *Note: If a passenger inadvertently boards the wrong elevator, they must exit the car at the next available stop and re-register their destination. The EZShuttle eliminates buttons and the ability to change destinations within the car.
