        <h3>Improve Energy Savings: Add a Re-Gen Drive</h3>
        <p>Adding a “Re-Gen Drive” to your system, acts as a line-power inverter by capturing energy produced by the elevator during over-hauling load conditions and recycling it back into the building’s power grid. Fujitec offers this option to further reduce energy consumption.</p>
