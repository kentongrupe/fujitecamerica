<h2>Flex-NX Series Dispatching</h2>
<p>
    The Flex-NX Series is one of Fujitec’s proudest technological achievements in dispatching solutions. Standard on all Viridian controllers, there are three available options with varying degrees of capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bold">FLEX-NX 101:</span> Best utilized in smaller buildings with a relatively limited amount of traffic.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bold">FLEX-NX 151:</span> Capabilities are best suited for mid-size buildings with a sizable amount of traffic.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="bold">FLEX-NX 251:</span> This solution compliments large-scale buildings with high traffic demands. The 251 Series incorporates a Neuro computer that simulates the learning patterns of a human brain to calculate the fastest and most efficient route of travel for passengers within a building. Software modification is not necessary, as the system continuously adapts to fluctuating traffic patterns which include but are not limited to: The relocation of tenants to different floors; an increase or decrease in building occupancy, changes in operational hours, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Depending on the traffic needs of your building, Fujitec’s FLEX-NX is designed to reduce wait times, improve traffic distribution and satisfy the destination needs of tenants. Fujitec firmly believes that our ability to deliver customized destination solutions provides invaluable support to customers that aim to improve building security, efficiency and overall desirability.
