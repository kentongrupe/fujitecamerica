    <h1>Fujitec IONFUL&reg; Improve the Air You Breathe</h1>
    <p>
        As we continue to search for ways to improve Fujitec products, safety is at the forefront of our goal which includes the internal health of our passengers during transport. While cab interiors can be a safe haven for airborne viruses and allergens, Fujitec’s Ionful&reg; incorporates technology from the Sharp Corporation to address these issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fujitec’s IONFUL&reg; uses Sharp’s Plasmacluster™ air purifying technology to split water molecules into positively and negatively charged ions that cleanse the air. Specifically designed for cab interiors, Fujitec’s IONFUL&reg; generator transports the ions through the ventilation system where they effectively attach, surround and break down potentially harmful air particles for purification. IONFUL&reg; is energy efficient and operates when movement is detected inside the cab.
