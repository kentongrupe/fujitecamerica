    <p>
        <span class="bold">Fujitec’s EZShuttle</span> is a Destination Floor Guidance System (DFGS) that reduces the expected number of stops, decreasing travel time during up-peak periods. The EZShuttle works in tandem with the Fujitec Viridian Controller and is best utilized for high-rise applications exceeding 40+ stories with excessive traffic and high occupancy.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Passenger registers desired floor using the keypad on the EZ-Shuttle fixture</li>
        <li>Elevator location/assignment is presented on the EZ-Shuttle display.</li>
        <li>Passenger moves to designated elevator and waits for arrival.</li>
        <li>While boarding, destinations are displayed on the floor indicator at the car’s entrance column.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        *Note: If a passenger inadvertently boards the wrong elevator, they must exit the car at the next available stop and re-register their destination. The EZShuttle eliminates buttons and the ability to change destinations within the car.
