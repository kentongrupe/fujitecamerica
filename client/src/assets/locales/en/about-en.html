    <h1>Message from the CEO</h1>
    <p class="profile">
        Elevators and escalators are indispensable parts of urban life that support smooth and effortless movement. Through daily research and development, we are committed to further improving your safety, quality and comfort.

        System development in the not-too distant future may have functions beyond our imagination. Just as space travel was once thought to be inconceivable or fantasy-like; our persistent efforts in research and development over the years are making the unthinkable a reality. If we dream of big solutions for advancing these systems, we will achieve new methods in innovative transportation.
    </p>
    <p class="profile">
        We have pursued the unknown and nurtured our dreams as "seeds of the future.” By nurturing these “seeds”, Fujitec has created the future of moving systems once thought to be far-reaching. In doing so, we are opening the door to a new era.

<div #history class="section">
    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
        In 1948, Fujitec began installing and servicing vertical transportation systems in Osaka, Japan. Led by founder and Honorary Chairman, Mr. Shotaro Uchiyama, Fujitec quickly became a well-respected leader within the industry expanding into Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Venezuela.
    </p>
    <p>
        North America opened operations in 1977 and now services 16 metropolitan areas. Fujitec earns maintenance, modernization and installation contracts through unparalleled service of all major systems, value-added maintenance and superior technical knowledge. Our ability to identify, evaluate and manage expectations allows for a proactive method of management that keeps systems running longer with minimal downtime and out-of-pocket expenses.
    </p>
    <p>
        Fujitec America services more than 9,500 units and has performed over 1000 modernizations over the past 10 years. Fujitec’s sustainable growth is attributed to its service-driven strategy that works to sustain the lowest number of units per mechanic in the industry. Our approach allows for increased preventative maintenance visits and decreased billable service calls over the life of the contract.
