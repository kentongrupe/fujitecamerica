            System development in the not-too distant future may have functions beyond our imagination. Just as space travel was once thought to be inconceivable or fantasy-like; our persistent efforts in research and development over the years are making the unthinkable a reality. If we dream of big solutions for advancing these systems, we will achieve new methods in innovative transportation.

            We have pursued the unknown and nurtured our dreams as "seeds of the future.” By nurturing these “seeds”, Fujitec has created the future of moving systems once thought to be far-reaching. In doing so, we are opening the door to a new era.

        <h1>North America</h1>
        <p>
            Fujitec America consists of 16 locations earning maintenance, modernization and installation contracts through unparalleled service of all major systems, value-added maintenance and superior technical knowledge. Our ability to identify, evaluate and manage expectations allows for a proactive method of management which keeps systems running longer with minimal downtime and out-of-pocket expenses.
        </p>
        <p>
            North America services more than 11,000 units alone and we attribute much of our growth to a service-driven strategy that aims to sustain an industry-low number of units per mechanic. This approach allows us to perform increased preventative maintenance visits, effectively decreasing billable service calls over the life of the contract.
        </p>
        <h1>Technological Achievements</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Developed the world’s first group supervisory control system that effectively uses AI from a neural computer inside the Fujitec elevator controller to calculate, discern and predict traffic patterns of humans within a building</li>
            <li>Fujitec’s first rope-less, linear motor-driven elevator that freely travels vertically, horizontally, curved or in a branched path</li>
            <li>Manufactured and installed one of the world’s largest passenger elevators capable of transporting an estimated 9 tons or approximately 120 passengers in Dubai</li>
            <li>Refining high-speed elevator capabilities that reach speeds in excess of 37mph</li>
            <li>Continued improvements in transportation comforts that properly adjust the internal pressurization of cabins and improving ride quality as buildings reach new heights</li>
            <li>The legend that is the “Nickel Test”</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>History and Global Operations</h1>
        <p>
            Shotaro Uchiyama founded Fuji Transportation Engineering and Manufacturing Co., Ltd in Osaka City, Japan in 1948. Specializing in the manufacturing and installation of elevators, Fuji Transportation opened their Tokyo operations in 1956 and eventually became the first Japanese elevator company to expand into Hong Kong in 1964. The following year added an operations facility in Osaka, and after continued expansion throughout the decade, Fuji Transportation officially changed their name to Fujitec Co., Ltd in 1974 and entered the American market in 1977.
        </p>
        <p>
            After substantial growth in the 80’s and 90’s, we entered the 21st century focusing resources on the construction and improvement of research and development facilities and manufacturing locations across the globe. These base locations are considered to be the heartbeat of the company and are dedicated to Fujitec’s continued procurement of product safety and development:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Big Wing – elevator (557 ft./170 m research tower)</li>
            <li>Big Step – escalator/auto-walk </li>
            <li>Big Fit – aftermarket product and service support</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Fujitec’s global headquarters moved to Tokyo in 2008 and operates 10 global production facilities in Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States and India that service 25 countries and regions worldwide.
