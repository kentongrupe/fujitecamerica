    <h1>webEMIS Monitoring Solution</h1>
    <p>
        Fujitec developed the webEMIS software to improve building safety and elevator efficiency. Real-time operations are monitored and adjusted from one or more locations, providing valuable traffic analysis in an effort to improve building efficiency during up-peak and down-peak traffic times.

    <h2>How it Works</h2>
    <p>
        On a basic level, webEMIS exchanges real-time data with an elevator’s control system to determine operational status and floor location. The status is controlled by the client and programmed to satisfy standard functions such as ‘normal group operation’ or ‘out of service’ scenarios. webEMIS also handles a unique variety of specialized requests such as ‘VIP dispatch’ or ‘special assistance’ operations.

    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <p>
        Fujitec’s webEMIS is available on new or existing Fujitec Millennium and Viridian equipment. The software communicates through an independent/secure server (supplied by Fujitec) via the building’s network, and includes a dedicated client computer (supplied by Fujitec) for monitoring and operation.
