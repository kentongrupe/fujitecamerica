                        Geared elevators are an older yet proven technology that bridges a monetary gap between MRL and gearless machines. These units are best applied in niche scenarios where speeds do not exceed 500 fpm.

                        While hydraulic elevators were a popular model for low-rise buildings in the 20th century, newer applications are available to improve efficiency and costs for buildings with such needs. Though the industry is moving toward newer/eco-friendly technology such as MRL’s, Fujitec provides a variety of solutions for in-ground, holeless and roped applications. While some consider the technology dated and limited in its’ capabilities, Fujitec is happy to educate, guide and provide you the most effective solution for any situation.

                        Fujitec developed the webEMIS software to improve building safety and elevator efficiency. Real-time operations are monitored and adjusted from one or more locations, providing valuable traffic analysis in an effort to improve building efficiency during up-peak and down-peak traffic times.

                    <p>
                        On a basic level, webEMIS exchanges real-time data with an elevator’s control system to determine operational status and floor location. The status is controlled by the client and programmed to satisfy standard functions such as ‘normal group operation’ or ‘out of service’ scenarios. webEMIS also handles a unique variety of specialized requests such as ‘VIP dispatch’ or ‘special assistance’ operations.

                        As we continue to search for ways to improve Fujitec products, safety is at the forefront of our goal which includes the internal health of our passengers during transport. While cab interiors can be a safe haven for airborne viruses and allergens, Fujitec’s Ionful&reg; incorporates technology from the Sharp Corporation to address these issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fujitec’s IONFUL&reg; uses Sharp’s Plasmacluster™ air purifying technology to split water molecules into positively and negatively charged ions that cleanse the air. Specifically designed for cab interiors, Fujitec’s IONFUL&reg; generator transports the ions through the ventilation system where they effectively attach, surround and break down potentially harmful air particles for purification. IONFUL&reg; is energy efficient and operates when movement is detected inside the cab.
