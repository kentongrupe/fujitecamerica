                                While hydraulic elevators were popular for low-rise buildings in the 20th century, newer applications are available to improve efficiency and costs for buildings with such needs. Though the industry is moving toward newer/eco-friendly technology such as MRL’s, Fujitec provides a variety of solutions for in-ground, holeless and roped applications. While considered dated and limited in its’ capabilities, Fujitec is happy to educate and provide you the most effective solution for any situation.

                                    Fujitec developed webEMIS to improve building safety and elevator efficiency. Real-time operations are monitored and adjusted from one or more locations, providing valuable traffic analysis in an effort to improve building efficiency during up-peak and down-peak traffic times.

                        <p>
                            webEMIS exchanges real-time data with an elevator’s control system to determine operational status and floor location. Status is controlled by the client and programmed to satisfy ‘normal group operation’ or ‘out of service’ scenarios. webEMIS also handles a variety of specialized requests such as ‘VIP dispatch’ or ‘special assistance’ operations.

                        Adding a “Re-Generative Drive” to your system, acts as a line-power inverter by capturing energy produced by the elevator during over-hauling load conditions and recycling it back into the building’s power grid. Fujitec offers this option to further reduce energy consumption.
